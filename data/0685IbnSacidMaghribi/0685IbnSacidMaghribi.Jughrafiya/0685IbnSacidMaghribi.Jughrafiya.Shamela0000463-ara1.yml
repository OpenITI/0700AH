90#VERS#COMMENT##: The pagination of this text is different from the
    edition I used, but other than that it is clear that the text is based
    on the edition used for annotation. Both versions of the text in the
    corpus are identical. The text is clearly typed. Some headings were
    probably removed during automatic tagging attempt by someone, which I
    inserted back.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Separated body text from the titles.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
