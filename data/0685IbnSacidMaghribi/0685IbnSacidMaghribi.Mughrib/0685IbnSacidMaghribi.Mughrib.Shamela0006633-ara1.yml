90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text has a very awkward structure. My leveling for the Kitabs is correct; however, after fourth-level headers, I’m not entirely sure about the leveling. 2- The first three biographical tags have subsections. I showed the subsections as paragraphs with two asterisks (i.e. # **) so that they are distinguishable. 3- I also checked the end of the tagged names to match the PDF. 4- A title must be added before PageV01P234 in front of my third-level blank header: “كتاب الكواكب الدرية في حلي كورة القبرية”. 5- Missing sections: PageV01P033-37; PageV02P002-4; PageV02P471-73 (the first four blank headers are for these missing sections).
