90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text has a very awkward structure. My leveling
    for the Kitabs is correct; however, after fourth-level headers, I’m not
    entirely sure about the leveling. 2- The first three biographical tags
    have subsections. I showed the subsections as paragraphs with two
    asterisks (i.e. # **) so that they are distinguishable. 3- I also
    checked the end of the tagged names to match the PDF. 4- A title must be
    added before PageV01P234 in front of my third-level blank header: “كتاب
    الكواكب الدرية في حلي كورة القبرية”. 5- Missing sections:
    PageV01P033-37; PageV02P002-4; PageV02P471-73 (the first four blank
    headers are for these missing sections).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
