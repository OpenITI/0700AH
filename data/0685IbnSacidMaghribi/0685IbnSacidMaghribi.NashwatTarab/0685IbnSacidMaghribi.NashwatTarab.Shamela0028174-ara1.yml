90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: I tried to present the correct leveling for the
        headers as far as possible. However, it is not easy to understand the
        relationship between these people and tribes unless someone reads the
        whole text very carefully. So, a specialist in Arabic genealogy might
        decide to change the leveling of the headers in some parts. I resumed
        the leveling in some parts because putting all the descendants of a
        specific person or tribe under his name will cause the leveling goes up
        to eighth-level headers and more.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
