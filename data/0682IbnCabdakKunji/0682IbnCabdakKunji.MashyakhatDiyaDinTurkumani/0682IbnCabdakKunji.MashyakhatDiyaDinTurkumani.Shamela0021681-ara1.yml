90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text is not a published book. It is a manuscript
        that has been transcribed. 2- The first Shaykh is “الشيخ الأول” as I can
        read it in the manuscript (and of course logically!), not “شيخ آخر” as
        transcribed in the digital version.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
