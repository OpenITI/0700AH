90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was generated through Google Drive OCR, and then
    formatted, cleaned up, corrected and annotated by Gowaart. The cleaning up is
    still in progress. Only sections marked CHECKED at the end have been closely
    compared to the edition, the other sections still include many typos.
    Update 2020-10-28: cleaned up page numbers, improved paragraphs, and changed
    hierarchy to make year changes more clearly recognisable (following manuscript
    logic more so than that of the edition). I have added two such year headers in
    square brackets, the first one of which likely formed part of a now lost section
    at the start of the third volume. The last one is entirely editorial, as the
    following parts were clearly added to the text at a later point (they all relate
    to the year 689 while years 687-8 are not dealt with at all). Some typos were
    corrected further, but the majority of the text still need further checking.
    This is on Gowaart's radar and will be ongoing for a while.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
