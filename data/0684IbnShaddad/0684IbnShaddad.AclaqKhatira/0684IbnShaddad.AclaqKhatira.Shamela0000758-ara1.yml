90#VERS#COMMENT##: JK and Shamela versions are the same text. Typist(s) apparently did not have access to a full set of all the volumes in the edition, for there are significant gaps: second qism of the first book (dealing with North Syria outside of Aleppo), first qism of the second book (dealing with Damascus itself, here only what is around Damascus (2.2.) is recorded). To make matters worse, not all volumes of the editions (cfr. Z. Antrim, "Ibn Shaddad" in EI3) are available in pdf, so from line 3592-6384 (vol. 2 qism 2) there is no pdf available, and the same is true for the last part starting from line 10159 until the end (vol. 3 qism 2). I've tagged these according to textual logic of the preceding parts as apparent from the digital versions. In the later parts of the text dealing with the Jazira some sections had been mistagged (instead of the title header, an occurrence of the placename in the body text), I have corrected these. 
 Schematically the situation can be rendered as follows:
 Vol. 1.1.: in Shamela - YES, Pdf - YES (Archive: FP38781)
 Vol. 1.2.: in Shamela - NO, Pdf - YES (Archive: FP38781)
 Vol. 2.1.: in Shamela - NO, Pdf - YES (Archive: aco000021_lo)
 Vol. 2.2.: in Shamela - YES, Pdf - NO
 Vol. 3.1.: in Shamela - YES, Pdf - YES (Archive: FP38781)
 Vol. 3.2.: in Shamela - YES, Pdf - NO
 The biggest issue at present is then the fact that vols. 1.2 and 2.1 are not in the digital version. I'm not very concerned about the ones included and tagged according to textual logic, as Ibn Shaddad is fairly easy to follow structurally. 
 There is page numbering throughout, but it is completely wrong -- everything in one volume -- and many paragraphs don't agree with the pdf (I have changed some of these where I could identify them easily). But the text agrees more or less (I have noticed some missing phrases and words here and there) with the edition so I have tagged accordingly.
