90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text has been tagged before; proper YML file is
        yet to be produced.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): At the end of vol 1 (page 381 and 441 ff), the
        editor has added an appendix which has two parts. The first is taken from a
        prior edition by Wüstenfeld, and the second is taken from a manuscript found
        after publishing the book. I deleted the editor’s explanations at the beginning
        of these sections as they are editorial, but kept and tagged the appended texts
        as they are parts of the main text. 2. Editorial removed.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
