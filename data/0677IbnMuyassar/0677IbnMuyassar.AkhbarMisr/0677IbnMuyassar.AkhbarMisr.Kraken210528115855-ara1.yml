90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Mathew Barber
90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * kraken version: 3.0.0.0b21.dev6
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: arabPers-WithDiffTypefaces.mlmodel
    * Deleted editor's introduction to the text
    * Removed footnotes
    * small corrections to the text, where I have spotted them
    * Mistakes at beginning and start of lines (missing characters, usually) -
    corrected these where I saw them
    * added lines missing from OCR on several pages
    * Added QB and QE tags where Qur'anic citations clearly demarcated in edition
    * One section after - PARATEXT - unclear if this should be attributed to Ibn
    Muyassar or al-Maqrizi
    * Removed indices
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The first edition of the text is accessible here: https://archive.org/details/AkhbarMisr02. This first edition is different, since the events of 363-387 AH which are shifted to the end of the text in the second edition, appear between years 501 and 515 AH (pages 43-56 in the PDF). Our digital edition is the second edition, and it corresponds to the PDF whose link I provided in version link.
