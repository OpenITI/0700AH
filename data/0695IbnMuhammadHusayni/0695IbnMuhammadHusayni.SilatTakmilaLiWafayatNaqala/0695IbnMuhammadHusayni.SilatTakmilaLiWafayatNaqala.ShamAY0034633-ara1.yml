90#VERS#COMMENT##: Deleted editorial introduction and footnote markers. The text
        was subdivided into volumes, but these are remarkably short. I have untagged the
        volumes as section headers, but left them in as text, as they may be useful as a
        proxy for the manuscript tradition. All the biographies start with the date of
        death rather than the name. I have made all of them start on a new paragraph.
        The text ends abruptly on p. 494, except for a handful of lines in the digital
        text which do not map onto p. 495 in the PDF. After this stop, the edited text
        actually continues until p. 689 (final bio has nr. 1242), so the missing pages
        need to be added to get to the full text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
