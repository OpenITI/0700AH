90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text did not have any automatic tags. 2- In some parts (especially in the third volume) it seems that the author quotes complete baabs and fasls from other sources. The problem is that there is no parent header to signify that the following chapters are quoted sections. So, I showed the beginning of such sections with blank headers. Ideally, a specialist must read the whole text and add titles in square brackets. The other problem is that these quoted baabs and fasls are not bold and appear as part of the sentences. So, it is very difficult to find them. I think I have found and tagged all of them (However, it is possible that I have missed a few ones). In cases where these baabs and fasls appear as part of the sentences (and cannot be tagged structurally), I just showed their places with two asterisks (i.e. # **). Ideally, titles must also be added here by a specialist so that they can be tagged.
