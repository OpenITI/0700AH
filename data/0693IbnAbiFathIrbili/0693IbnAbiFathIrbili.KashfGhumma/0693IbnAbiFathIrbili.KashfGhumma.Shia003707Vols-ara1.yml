90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text did not have any automatic tags. 2- In some
    parts (especially in the third volume) it seems that the author quotes
    complete baabs and fasls from other sources. The problem is that there
    is no parent header to signify that the following chapters are quoted
    sections. So, I showed the beginning of such sections with blank
    headers. Ideally, a specialist must read the whole text and add titles
    in square brackets. The other problem is that these quoted baabs and
    fasls are not bold and appear as part of the sentences. So, it is very
    difficult to find them. I think I have found and tagged all of them
    (However, it is possible that I have missed a few ones). In cases where
    these baabs and fasls appear as part of the sentences (and cannot be
    tagged structurally), I just showed their places with two asterisks
    (i.e. # **). Ideally, titles must also be added here by a specialist so
    that they can be tagged.
    All paratextual elements
